# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Resources

The **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology.

**Exam Guide:**

There are two versions of this exam, CLF-C01 and CLF-C02, people who have given this exam before 19th Sep 2023, have taken CLF-C01.

**Difference:** The main difference is incorporating some syllabi and changing the weightage in the four domains. The guide for the updated version is given below.

**Whitepapers:** https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/

It is always better to read the AWS whitepaper, as it contains up-to-date information about the services, which will be asked in the exam.
